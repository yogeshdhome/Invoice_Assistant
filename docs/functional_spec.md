# Functional Specification: Invoice Status Chatbot

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional specifications for the Invoice Status Chatbot. The chatbot is a multi-lingual, conversational AI solution designed to provide users with the status of their PO (Purchase Order) and Non-PO (ACR) invoices.

## 2. User Roles

-   **End User**: An external vendor or internal employee seeking to find the status of one or more invoices.

## 3. User Stories

-   **As an End User, I want to...**
    -   ...start a conversation with the chatbot with a simple greeting.
    -   ...be informed of the chatbot's capabilities upon greeting.
    -   ...be able to ask for the status of a PO-based invoice.
    -   ...be able to ask for the status of one or more Non-PO (ACR) based invoices.
    -   ...be prompted for the necessary information if I don't provide it initially.
    -   ...provide a PO number and Invoice number for a PO invoice query.
    -   ...provide an ACR number or Invoice Number, along with an Invoice Document Date, for a Non-PO query.
    -   ...provide details for up to 50 Non-PO invoices at once.
    -   ...receive the status of my invoice(s) in a clear, easy-to-understand language.
    -   ...be notified if the invoice(s) I'm asking about cannot be found.
    -   ...be asked for my satisfaction with the provided answer.
    -   ...provide my contact details to create a support ticket if I am not satisfied.
    -   ...receive a support ticket number for follow-up.
    -   ...end the conversation politely if I am satisfied.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Conversation Initiation
-   **FR1.1**: The user can initiate a conversation by selecting an option (PO/Non-PO) or sending a text-based greeting.
-   **FR1.2**: If the user sends a greeting, the chatbot shall respond with a welcome message, state its purpose, and list its capabilities (PO/Non-PO invoice status, 50 invoice limit).

### FR2: Intent Identification
-   **FR2.1**: The chatbot must determine if the user is asking about a PO or Non-PO invoice.
-   **FR2.2**: If the intent is unclear, the chatbot must ask a clarifying question: "Are you enquiring about PO or NON PO(ACR) based invoices?"

### FR3: Data Collection
-   **FR3.1 (PO)**: If the intent is "PO", the chatbot must ask for a single PO Number and a single Invoice Number. It should also ask if the user wants to check the status of all invoices for that PO.
-   **FR3.2 (Non-PO)**: If the intent is "Non-PO", the chatbot must ask for either an ACR or Invoice Number, plus an Invoice Document Date, for up to 50 invoices in a comma-separated format.

### FR4: Backend Integration
-   **FR4.1**: The chatbot must generate a JSON payload from the collected information.
-   **FR4.2**: The chatbot must call the SAP S/4HANA API with the JSON payload to retrieve the invoice status.
-   **FR4.3**: The chatbot must interpret the API response and explain the status to the user in natural language.

### FR5: Escalation and Feedback
-   **FR5.1**: If the invoice is not found in SAP, the chatbot must inform the user and suggest they check their details or try again later.
-   **FR5.2**: After providing a status, the chatbot must ask the user for satisfaction ("Are you satisfied with the information provided?").
-   **FR5.3**: If the user responds "No", the chatbot must collect their email ID and vendor number.
-   **FR5.4**: The chatbot must call the ServiceNow API to create an interaction ticket, using the conversation history as an attachment.
-   **FR5.5**: The chatbot must provide the created ticket number to the user.

### FR6: Conversation Termination
-   **FR6.1**: If the user responds "Yes" to the satisfaction query, the chatbot shall provide a polite closing message and end the conversation.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
-   **NFR1**: The chatbot must be multi-lingual.
-   **NFR2**: The system must handle user inputs securely, following responsible AI practices.
-   **NFR3**: All interactions should be logged for analytics and debugging purposes.
